# Known Bugs / Limitations

- Vehicle GPS route (History → Vehicles → click plate → map): the route is built only from
  manual GPS pings sent via the Telegram bot's "🚛 Vehicle GPS" flow, not from a continuous
  live track. Points appear only when a driver explicitly sends a location for that vehicle.

- `requirements.txt` is missing `python-multipart`. FastAPI refuses to start without it
  ("Form data requires python-multipart"). Production works only because the package is
  installed system-wide. A clean install from `requirements.txt` fails. Found 2026-10-13.
- `install.sh` in the repo root is not a Forest AI file: it is the third-party installer of
  `DeusData/codebase-memory-mcp`. It does not install Forest AI. Found 2026-10-13; left in place
  pending the owner's decision.
- Before/after photo comparison (`services/photo_compare.py`): sector BIK-001, point P1 was
  marked "same place: yes" for two photos of different marker posts (different symbols,
  different path). False same-place match; 15 of 30 points also unmatched. Seen 2026-10-13
  on a screenshot, root cause not yet investigated.
- `bot.py` hardcodes the dashboard link as `http://164.90.188.136:8000` (3 places). A bot for
  a client instance would send users to the main dashboard.
